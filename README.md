<h1 align="center">👁️‍🗨️ ElderEye: Family-Centered IoT Smart Care System</h1>
<p align="center">
  <b>Real-time elderly monitoring platform combining live video streaming and anomaly detection</b><br/>
  <i>Providing peace of mind for families and caregivers — anytime, anywhere.</i>
</p>

## 📌 Overview

**ElderEye** is a modular smart care system designed to continuously monitor the safety and well-being of elderly family members.  
It seamlessly integrates **real-time video streaming**, **deep learning-powered behavior anomaly detection**, and **instant mobile alerts** to act as a reliable "eye and ear" for families and caregivers.

Built on a **Hybrid Microservice Architecture**, ElderEye ensures scalability, modularity, and robust observability.  
Each service can be deployed independently, with comprehensive system monitoring enabled via **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.

## 🚀 Key Features

- [1] **Family-Centered Real-Time Video Streaming:** Low-latency, multi-party video streaming using Mediasoup SFU to keep family members connected.  
- [2] **Behavior Anomaly Detection:** Integration with an external deep learning model via gRPC for intelligent anomaly recognition.  
- [3] **Persistent Event Logging:** Reliable CRUD operations and event storage powered by MySQL.  
- [4] **Instant Mobile Alerts:** Timely notifications to caregivers through a React Native mobile app.  
- [5] **Modular Microservices:** Independent deployment and scalability of backend services.  
- [6] **Full Observability:** System health and metrics tracking with Prometheus and Grafana.
- [7] **Data Privacy:** Sensitive personal data securely encrypted at rest in the database using AES-256.  
- [8] **Authentication:** User authentication and authorization managed via JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- [9] **Access Control:** Principle of Least Privilege (POLP) enforced to restrict permissions to only what is necessary for each user and service.
